she said she doesn't remember seeing me at all last night. ...I was with her for six hours, there's no way she could have been blackout the whole time
The amount of guys I've turned down for you is disgusting... You better love me.
Life update: This fucking MacBook repair guy called me over last night for a booty call and he didnâ€™t have a condom OR a bed
Were not even through the second month of the year and I potentially may have torpedoed a marriage...
I think I came out of my blackout as I was ordering wine from the private wedding reception.
Please wake up and help me figure out how I woke up on the floor with my head under the couch
